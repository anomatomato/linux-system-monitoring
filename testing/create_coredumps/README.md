## 1. Create coredumps on your system (for testing purposes) 

In order to ==**enable coredumps**== on your system, open terminal and run

```bash
ulimit -c ulimited
```

In order to ==**create an example coredump**== on your system, run

```bash
./infinite
```

or

```bash
./segmentation_fault
```

By default the core dump files are stored in `/var/lib/systemd/coredump` and can be listed with 
`coredumpctl list`. 

## 2. What even is a coredump??

A core dump is a file that gets automatically generated by the Linux kernel after a program crashes. This file contains the 
**memory, register values, and the call stack of an application at the point of crashing**.

For more information on coredumps read [this page](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/managing-core-dumps) and read the man pages of [coredumpctl(1)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/coredumpctl.1.html).

***Good luck*** :wink:
