.SH NAME
sd-journal-to-influxdb - Send the filtered Systemd-Journals to server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
journal-to-influxdb server
.SH DESCRIPTION

sd-journal-to-influxdb reads journal entries from a journal file in the /var/log/journal/remote directory of the Docker container systemd-journal-remote via sd-journal(3) and converts them into the Line Protocol. Subsequently, the journal logs are sent to InfluxDB via MQTT.

To be able to directly read journal files in the /var/log/journal/remote directory of the Docker container systemd-journal-remote, sd-journal-to-influxdb must run in the same environment as sd-journal-filter. Therefore, it is executed in a Docker container named metrics-to-influxdb() with the desired environment (together with the component coredump-to-influxdb). In this container, the two Docker containers metrics-to-influxdb and systemd-journal-remote share the same volume systemd-journal-data, whose value is /var/log/journal/remote.
